#' The ShinyStan interface and shinystan R package
#'
#' @description Applied Bayesian data analysis is primarily implemented through 
#'   the MCMC algorithms offered by various software packages. When analyzing a 
#'   posterior sample obtained by one of these algorithms the first step is to 
#'   check for signs that the chains have converged to the target distribution 
#'   and and also for signs that the algorithm might require tuning or might be 
#'   ill-suited for the given model. There may also be theoretical problems or 
#'   practical inefficiencies with the specification of the model. ShinyStan
#'   provides interactive plots and tables helpful for analyzing a posterior
#'   sample, with particular attention to identifying potential problems with
#'   the performance of the MCMC algorithm or the specification of the model. 
#'   ShinyStan is powered by RStudio's Shiny web application framework and works
#'   with the output of MCMC programs written in any programming language (and
#'   has extended functionality for models fit using the rstan package and the
#'   No-U-Turn sampler).
#' 
#' @section ShinyStan has extended functionality for Stan models:
#'   
#'   Stan (\url{http://mc-stan.org}) models can be run in R using the
#'   \pkg{rstan} package.
#' 
#' @section Saving and sharing:
#'   
#'   The shinystan package allows you to store the basic components of an entire
#'   project (code, posterior samples, graphs, tables, notes) in a single 
#'   object. Users can save many of the plots as ggplot2 objects for further 
#'   customization and easy integration in reports or post-processing for 
#'   publication.
#'   
#'   The new version of shinystan also provides the `deploy_shinystan` function,
#'   which lets you easily deploy your own ShinyStan apps online using RStudio's
#'   ShinyApps (\url{https://www.shinyapps.io}) service for any of your models. 
#'   Each of your apps (each of your models) will have a unique url and is 
#'   compatible with Safari, Firefox, Chrome, and most other browsers.

#'  version 3 (GPLv3).

#'  Check out the demo using \code{\link{launch_shinystan_demo}} or try it with
#'  one of your own models using \code{\link{launch_shinystan}}.
